# Data-Visualization-with-Python
This is my submission for Peer Graded Assignment: Data-Visualization-with-Python.
## Introduction
In this Assignment, You will be required to generate two visualization plots. The first one will be a plot to summarize the results of a survey that was conducted to gauge an audience interest in different data science topics. The second plot is a Choropleth map of the crime rate in San Francisco.

A survey was conducted to gauge an audience interest in different data science topics, namely:
- Big Data (Spark / Hadoop)
- Data Analysis / Statistics
- Data Journalism
- Data Visualization
- Deep Learning
- Machine Learning
The participants had three options for each topic: **Very Interested, Somewhat interested, and Not interested. 2,233** respondents completed the survey.

The survey results have been saved in a csv file and can be accessed through this link: https://cocl.us/datascience_survey_data.

In the final question, you are required to create a Choropleth map to visualize crime in San Francisco.
The San Francisco dataset  can be download through this link: https://cocl.us/sanfran_crime_dataset,
